These predictions are about technologies related to [Big Data Distributed Systems](/tech/2013/12/30/2014-technologies-to-watch.html). The list below isn't meant to be comprehensive as the focus here is on new and emerging projects that we'll hear more about in 2014.

# Infrastructure
- [Google Compute Engine](cloud.google.com/products/compute-engine/) will become the biggest [AWS](aws.amazon.com/) competitor, but won't make a dent in AWS growth and usage.
- Several large commercial data-driven distributed systems will be running on [Docker](www.docker.io).
- Docker will enable at least one use-case previously impossible due to the weight of the virtualization layer.
- At least two large-scale distributed systems will forgo virtualization layer in favour of running on Docker with [CoreOS](coreos.com), without VMs.
- [Redis Sentinel](redis.io/topics/sentinel) will be used as a fully-featured alternative to [ZooKeeper](zookeeper.apache.org) in a large-scale distributed system. 

My reasoning is [here](/tech/2013/12/30/Infrastructure-for-distributed-systems--2014-technologies-to-watch.html).

# Data processing
- [Spark](spark.incubator.apache.org) will be the fastest growing general-purpose data processing technology. Several big distributed systems will use Hadoop/Spark hybrid architecture by replacing Hadoop MapReduce jobs to Spark engine, while still using data from HDFS.
- In 24 months Spark and it's eco-system will displace Hadoop MapReduce as typical way to run MapReduce.

My reasoning is [here](/tech/2013/12/30/Big-Data-Technologies-growing-in-2014.html).

I can't wait for the beggining of 2015 to check back on these predictions!
