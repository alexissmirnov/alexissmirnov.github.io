End of the year is a great time for reflection, for looking forward to the next year. In technology space it's become a fun tradition to make predictions about the upcoming year. To make predictions more meaningful, it's interesting to ask a broader question. What technology will be the most important in the future?

Ask this question without imposing any constrains and you may get answers about energy, space exploration, biology, artificial intelligence. After all, the most important technologies will be those that solve the biggest problems and provide the most powerful tools.

What's fascinating about all these technologies is that they have one thing in common: software. Two and a half years ago Marc Andressen penned a widely cited essay titled [Why Software is Eating the World](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460). His central thesis remains true today: more and more industries "from movies to agriculture to national defence" are becoming largely software industries. Software is becoming key for solving more and bigger problems. The most powerful tools of the future will be software tools.

If software will be at the center of most important technologies of the future, then which software technologies will be the most important? One can argue there are a great many of them. Time and energy invested in these software technologies would have a compounded effect, accelerating solutions to world's biggest problems and creating the most powerful tools.

My view is, distributed systems or, more specifically, Big Data Distributed Systems will be one of the most (if not the most) important software technology of the future. Those systems that generate, collect, process, analyze and ultimately derive value from large and fast-growing datasets. They run on a very large number of compute nodes. And they usually serve millions of users, ether directly or indirectly.

Aren't there tremendous advances in other types of software technologies? Why would mobile apps, wearable apps, HTML5 or augmented reality would have less of an impact? The reasons are twofold.

First, technologies that deliver breakthrough user experiences of the future (via mobile apps, web apps, wearable apps) will all rely to large extent on data-driven distributed systems providing much of the value. For example, when a Maps app on your iPhone informs you of the heavy traffic up ahead, it surfaces the results of the work performed by a data-driven distributed system.

Second, any system that solves a big problem in any industry will run on a distributed system, and much of those systems will use large and growing datasets. A true artificial intelligence that rivals the ability of the human brain will run on one. The breakthrough in clean energy will also run on one.

The world's data is growing at compounded annual growth rate of around 45%, which means a 44X increase in the next 10 years. This is a direct consequence of entire industries becoming software-based, a direct outcome of "software eating the world". Distributed system that stands a chance to solve a big problem needs to deal with datasets that follow such growth rate.

The fact that foundational technologies have disproportionate impact on our lives should be surprising. We've seen this before. Advances in transportation enabled trade. Advances in electrical grid spurred so many transformational technologies that rely on electricity. Data-driven distributed systems is one of those foundational technologies.

These systems are essential, yet they are also very new. Their adoption outside of internet giants has really just started over the last few years. Their fundamentals are still in active development. There is no way to know for sure what specific technologies will be at the hart of such systems in 10 years. But things are more clear looking one year ahead.

In the [next blog](/tech/2013/12/30/Big-Data-Distributed-Systems--2014-predictions.html) I'll note my own predictions, so that I can check back in a year.
